1. Introduction

The prevalence of fraudulent activities in banking transactions necessitates the development of robust fraud detection systems. In this report, we present a web application designed for analyzing bank transactions and detecting fraud. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to process transaction data and generate reports with graphical and tabular representations for comprehensive analysis.

2. Overview of the Web Application

The web application provides users with the following main functions:

Data set preparation: Preparation of the transaction data set for training and evaluation of the fraud detection model.
Use of machine learning algorithms: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
Report generation: Creation of reports with graphs, tables, and transaction analysis for insights into the data.
Comparison of algorithm performance: Assessment of the operation and accuracy of three different machine learning algorithms.
3. Technologies Used

Python v3+: Programming language for developing the application.
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn: Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
Streamlit: Web application framework for building interactive user interfaces.
4. Dataset Description

The project utilizes a free data set obtained from Kaggle, comprising credit card transactions categorized as legitimate and fraudulent. This data set serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the fraud detection model.

5. Implementation Details

Data Set Preparation: The transaction data set is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Three different machine learning algorithms are implemented for fraud detection.
Report Generation: The application generates reports with graphs, tables, and detailed transaction analysis to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
Manual Transaction Verification: Users can manually verify transactions by inputting transaction details into the application interface.
6. Results and Analysis

Comparison of Algorithm Performance: The operation and accuracy of the three machine learning algorithms are compared to identify the most effective approach for fraud detection.
Transaction Analysis: The application provides insights into transaction patterns, trends, and anomalies through graphical and tabular representations.
7. Conclusion

The web application offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing bank transactions and detecting fraud. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and interactive reporting capabilities, the application empowers users to make informed decisions and mitigate risks associated with fraudulent activities.

8. Future Enhancements

Integration of additional machine learning algorithms for further improving fraud detection accuracy.
Enhancement of user interface features for better usability and interactivity.
Incorporation of real-time data streaming capabilities for continuous monitoring of transactions.
